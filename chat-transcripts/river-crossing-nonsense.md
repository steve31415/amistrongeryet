# The nonsense-words version of the river-crossing puzzle

*[Me] Here is a logic puzzle. I need to carry a bleem, a fleem, and a gleem across a river. I can only carry one item at a time with me in the boat. I can't leave the bleem alone with the fleem, and I can't leave the fleem alone with the gleem. How can I get everything the other side of the river?*

> Here's a solution to the problem:
> 
> 1. Take the fleem across the river.
> 2. Go back and get the bleem.
> 3. When you arrive with the bleem, take the fleem back across the river with you.
> 4. Leave the fleem and take the gleem across the river.
> 5. Leave the gleem and go back to get the fleem.
> 6. Take the fleem across the river for the final time.
> 
> Now, all three items - the bleem, fleem, and gleem - are safely on the other side of the river.
