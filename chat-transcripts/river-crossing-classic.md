# The classic river-crossing puzzle

*[Me] Here is a logic puzzle. I need to carry a cabbage, a goat, and a wolf across a river. I can only carry one item at a time with me in the boat. I can't leave the goat alone with the cabbage, and I can't leave the wolf alone with the goat. How can I get everything the other side of the river?*

> To solve this puzzle, follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Take the goat across the river first and leave it on the other side.
> 2. Go back to the original side and pick up the cabbage.
> 3. When you arrive at the other side with the cabbage, take the goat back with you to the original side.
> 4. Leave the goat on the original side and take the wolf across the river.
> 5. After leaving the wolf with the cabbage on the other side, go back to the original side to pick up the goat.
> 6. Finally, take the goat across the river again to join the cabbage and the wolf.
> 
> By following these steps, you ensure that the goat is never left alone with the cabbage and the wolf is never left alone with the goat.
