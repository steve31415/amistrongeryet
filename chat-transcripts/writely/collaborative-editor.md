In this chat session, I asked GPT-4 how to implement a web-based collaborative document editor, supporting IE 6 era browsers.
Specifically, I asked it how to synchronize changes between users who are editing the same document at the same time.

> *[Me] You are an experienced and talented software engineer, with a thorough knowledge of published algorithms, as well as a knack for finding out-of-the-box solutions to problems that have not been solved previously. You are implementing the backend server for a collaborative document editor. Users can open a document in a browser, and the browser's contentEditable option is used to allow the user to edit the document's HTML code. If two or more users open the same document, we would like to synchronize their changes, so that they can edit the same document at the same time (assuming they are working in different parts of the document), and each user will see the others' changes. How can this be implemented? We need to support old browsers such as IE 6, so the amount of code we can run in the browser is very limited; most work needs to be done on our server.*

> To implement a collaborative document editor that supports older browsers like IE 6, you can follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Choose a data structure to represent the document: Since you need to support efficient concurrent edits, use a data structure like a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT). CRDTs are designed to allow multiple users to edit a shared data structure while minimizing conflicts. One example of a CRDT suitable for text editing is a positional tree CRDT.
> 
> 2. Set up the backend server: Create a server using a language and framework of your choice (e.g., Node.js with Express or Python with Flask). The server should maintain a copy of the document, handle incoming edit requests from clients, and synchronize the document between all connected clients.
> 
> 3. Implement the communication protocol: To support older browsers like IE 6, you can use long-polling as a fallback mechanism for real-time communication between the client and server. Long-polling involves the client sending a request to the server and waiting for a response. The server only responds when it has new data, simulating real-time updates. Modern browsers can use WebSockets for more efficient real-time communication.
> 
> 4. Apply document changes: When a user makes changes to the document, the browser should send the changes to the server. The changes can be encoded as a series of operations like insertions and deletions, along with their positions within the document. The server applies these changes to its copy of the document using the CRDT data structure.
> 
> 5. Synchronize document updates: After applying a change, the server should send the change to all connected clients, including the one that initiated the change. Clients then update their local copy of the document based on the received changes.
> 
> 6. Handle conflicts: CRDTs are designed to minimize conflicts, but you still need to handle the cases when conflicts occur (e.g., two users editing the same part of the document simultaneously). You can resolve conflicts by applying changes in the order they are received, or by using timestamps or version vectors to determine the correct order.
> 
> 7. Optimizations: To improve the performance of the system, you can implement several optimizations. For example, you can use operational transformation (OT) to compress multiple operations into a single operation, reducing the number of messages sent between clients and the server.
> 
> In summary, to build a collaborative document editor that supports older browsers, you can use a CRDT data structure for representing the document, set up a backend server to handle edit requests and synchronization, implement long-polling for real-time communication, and apply a series of optimizations for improved performance.

This answer is generally quite good. CRDTs and Node.js are solid choices here, and the explanations are solid. Long polling is precisely
the right tool to use with a browser like IE 6, and the description of how to organize the system is spot on. However, CRDTs are a known
solution precisely because the task I posed – building a basic collaborative document editor – is, at this point, old hat, with extensive
discussion available within GPT-4's training data. In attempt to evaluate GPT-4's capability for tackling *novel* problems, I pushed it
for a different solution.

> *Unfortunately, because we need to support older browsers, we cannot implement document editing operations ourselves. Instead, we are relying on the browser's "contentEditable" support to implement editing operations such as typing, cut / copy / paste, and style changes. This requires us to use the browser DOM as our data structure, which we can access using the innerHTML property. The browser DOM is not a CRDT, and also we are not implementing the edit operations ourselves, so we cannot use solutions that require CRDTs.*

> Understood. Given the constraints of using the browser's contentEditable support and innerHTML property, you can still implement a collaborative document editor with the following approach:
> 
> 1. Set up the backend server: Create a server using a language and framework of your choice (e.g., Node.js with Express or Python with Flask). The server should maintain a copy of the document and handle incoming edit requests from clients.
> 
> 2. Implement the communication protocol: Use long-polling for real-time communication between the client and server, as mentioned previously. This will allow you to support older browsers like IE 6. Modern browsers can use WebSockets for more efficient real-time communication.
> 
> 3. Detect changes: On the client side, listen for changes to the contentEditable element using events like 'input', 'keyup', 'cut', 'copy', 'paste', and others. When a change occurs, extract the differences between the previous and current innerHTML content. You can use a library like google-diff-match-patch to compute these differences efficiently.
> 
> 4. Send changes to the server: When changes are detected, send the differences (as patches) to the server along with their positions within the innerHTML content.
> 
> 5. Apply changes on the server: Apply the received patches to the server's copy of the document, updating its innerHTML content.
> 
> 6. Synchronize document updates: After applying a change, the server should send the change to all connected clients, including the one that initiated the change. Clients then update their local copy of the innerHTML content based on the received patches.
> 
> 7. Handle conflicts: To handle conflicts (e.g., two users editing the same part of the document simultaneously), use a timestamp or unique identifier for each client to determine the order in which changes are applied. Apply changes in the order they are received, and if changes conflict, prioritize changes based on their timestamps or identifiers.
> 
> 8. Optimizations: To improve the performance of the system, you can batch multiple updates from the same client before sending them to the server, reducing the number of messages sent between clients and the server. Additionally, you can debounce the change events on the client-side to prevent excessive updates.
> 
> In summary, while using the browser's contentEditable support and innerHTML property presents some challenges, you can still implement a collaborative document editor by detecting changes, computing differences, and synchronizing updates between clients and the server using long-polling or WebSockets. Additionally, handle conflicts by applying changes in a determined order and implement optimizations to improve performance.

This is another good answer, although as noted in the blog post, the "google-diff-match-patch" library that it relies on was
actually developed by a member of the Google Docs team, so once again this demonstrates GPT-4's ability to find an exist
solutions, rather than solving a novel problem.
