# Session With Explicit Guidance

In this chat session, I again asked GPT-4 to implement an algorithm for compactly describing the difference between two
strings, subject to the constraints we faced when implementing Writely (the original version of Google Docs). However, I
avoided giving it explicit hints, mostly limiting myself to providing the information it would have had available if it
were tackling the problem on its own.

The initial prompt is identical to the previous chat session, minus the hint about not iterating through each character
individually. (I still gave it the high-level guidance that execution speed is more important than minimizing the amount
of data to be sent to the server.)

> *[Me] You are an experienced and talented software engineer, with a thorough knowledge of published algorithms, as well as a knack for finding out-of-the-box solutions to problems that have not been solved previously. Please write a JavaScript program to compare two strings, find the difference between them, and produce a compact representation of that difference. The representation must contain enough information to allow the second string to be reconstructed from the first string. This code needs to be able to run on old browsers such as IE 6, which had very inefficient JavaScript engines, so the code must do as little work as possible. It is not necessary that the representation be optimally minimal, we can use an approach that creates a larger-than-optimal representation of the difference if this allows for fewer execution steps in the code. Also, don't rely on any libraries, you can only use the basic functions built into JavaScript.*

> Here's a simple JavaScript program that compares two strings and produces a compact representation of the differences between them. This code should work on older browsers, such as IE 6, and does not rely on any libraries:

```
function stringDifference(str1, str2) {
  var i = 0, j = 0;
  var diffs = [];

  while (i < str1.length || j < str2.length) {
    if (str1[i] !== str2[j]) {
      diffs.push([i, j, str2[j]]);
      j++;
    } else {
      i++;
      j++;
    }
  }

  return diffs;
}

function reconstructString(str1, diffs) {
  var str2 = "";
  var i = 0, j = 0;

  while (i < str1.length || j < diffs.length) {
    if (j < diffs.length && i === diffs[j][0]) {
      str2 += diffs[j][2];
      i = diffs[j][1];
      j++;
    } else {
      str2 += str1[i];
      i++;
    }
  }

  return str2;
}

var str1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
var str2 = "The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog";
var diffs = stringDifference(str1, str2);
var reconstructedStr = reconstructString(str1, diffs);

console.log("Differences:", diffs);
console.log("Reconstructed string:", reconstructedStr);
```

> This code contains two functions: `stringDifference` and `reconstructString`. The `stringDifference` function compares two strings and returns an array containing the positions where the characters differ and the corresponding characters in the second string. The `reconstructString` function takes the first string and the differences array, and reconstructs the second string.

This response was sort of plausible, but contained a bug. Note that in this chat session, I don't provide much guidance,
I’m just telling it what it would learn if it tested the program itself. This is more like the situation an AI would
encounter if it was taking on the role of a software engineer without close mentorship.

> *When I run this program, it never terminates – there seems to be an infinite loop.*

> You are correct, there is an issue with the provided solution that can cause an infinite loop. My apologies for the oversight. Here is an updated solution that should work correctly:

```
function stringDifference(str1, str2) {
  var i = 0, j = 0;
  var diffs = [];

  while (i < str1.length || j < str2.length) {
    if (str1[i] !== str2[j]) {
      diffs.push([i, j, str2[j] || ""]);
      j++;
    } else {
      i++;
      j++;
    }

    if (i >= str1.length && j >= str2.length) {
      break;
    }
  }

  return diffs;
}

function reconstructString(str1, diffs) {
  var str2 = "";
  var i = 0, j = 0;

  while (i < str1.length || j < diffs.length) {
    if (j < diffs.length && i === diffs[j][0]) {
      str2 += diffs[j][2];
      i = diffs[j][1];
      j++;
    } else {
      str2 += str1[i] || "";
      i++;
    }

    if (i >= str1.length && j >= diffs.length) {
      break;
    }
  }

  return str2;
}

var str1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
var str2 = "The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog";
var diffs = stringDifference(str1, str2);
var reconstructedStr = reconstructString(str1, diffs);

console.log("Differences:", diffs);
console.log("Reconstructed string:", reconstructedStr);
```

> In the `stringDifference` and `reconstructString` functions, I've added a condition to break the loop if `i` and `j` are both greater than or equal to the lengths of the respective strings. This should prevent the infinite loop issue, and the program should now terminate as expected.

This time, I gave a little bit of guidance – it should try to do something to diagnose the problem.

> *This still infinite loops. What could I do to help diagnose the problem?*

> I apologize for the continued oversight. Let's diagnose the problem by adding console.log statements to see the progress of the loops and find where the issue occurs.

  var diffs = [];

  while (i < str1.length || j < str2.length) {
    console.log('stringDifference loop:', i, j); // Debugging line

    if (str1[i] !== str2[j]) {
      diffs.push([i, j, str2[j] || ""]);
      j++;
    } else {
      i++;
      j++;
    }

    if (i >= str1.length && j >= str2.length) {
      break;

}

    if (j < diffs.length && i === diffs[j][0]) {
      str2 += diffs[j][2];
      j++;
    } else {
      str2 += str1[i] || "";
      i++;
    }

    if (i >= str1.length && j >= diffs.length) {
      break;
    }
  }

  return str2;
}

var str1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
var str2 = "The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog";
var diffs = stringDifference(str1, str2);
var reconstructedStr = reconstructString(str1, diffs);

console.log("Differences:", diffs);
console.log("Reconstructed string:", reconstructedStr);
```

This was a reasonable next step. I shared the output, and GPT-4 successfully corrected the bug:

Thank you for sharing the output. It appears that the issue lies within the `stringDifference` function. The variable `i` is not being incremented when a difference is found, causing an infinite loop. Here's the corrected implementation:

```
function stringDifference(str1, str2) {
  var i = 0, j = 0;
  var diffs = [];

  while (i < str1.length || j < str2.length) {
    if (str1[i] !== str2[j]) {
      diffs.push([i, j, str2[j] || ""]);
      i++;
      j++;
    } else {
      i++;
      j++;
    }
  }

  return diffs;
}

function reconstructString(str1, diffs) {
  var str2 = "";
  var i = 0, j = 0;

  while (i < str1.length || j < diffs.length) {
    if (j < diffs.length && i === diffs[j][0]) {
      str2 += diffs[j][2];
      i++;
      j++;
    } else {
      str2 += str1[i] || "";
      i++;
    }
  }

  return str2;
}

var str1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
var str2 = "The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog";
var diffs = stringDifference(str1, str2);
var reconstructedStr = reconstructString(str1, diffs);

console.log("Differences:", diffs);
console.log("Reconstructed string:", reconstructedStr);
```

> Now, the variable `i` is incremented correctly when a difference is found, which should prevent the infinite loop.

This program is correct, but has a couple of shortcomings. It examines characters one by one, so it would be too slow in
practice. (Recall that in this scenario, I haven’t yet explicitly informed GPT-4 that it will need to do better than looking
at characters one at a time.) It also fails to gracefully handle situations where the length of the document has changed; it
will wind up transmitting the entire file starting at the point of change.

I gave it sample output for a case that illustrates the second issue. I included some subtle hints here, but mostly left it on its own:

> *Great! This appears to work.*
> 
> *Next, I tested it where str2 contains "goat" instead of "cat". It worked correctly, but the representation of the difference was quite large:*
> 
> *"Differences:", [[16, 16, "g"], [18, 18, "a"], [19, 19, "t"], [20, 20, " "], [21, 21, "j"], [22, 22, "u"], [23, 23, "m"], [24, 24, "p"], [25, 25, "s"], [26, 26, " "], [27, 27, "o"], [28, 28, "v"], [29, 29, "e"], [30, 30, "r"], [31, 31, " "], [32, 32, "t"], [33, 33, "h"], [34, 34, "e"], [35, 35, " "], [36, 36, "l"], [37, 37, "a"], [38, 38, "z"], [39, 39, "y"], [40, 40, " "], [41, 41, "d"], [42, 42, "o"], [43, 43, "g"]]*
> 
> *Do you know why the difference is so large when str1 and str2 are identical except that the word "fox" is changed to "goat"?*

> Yes, the issue with the large difference representation is because the current implementation doesn't properly handle situations where the second string has characters inserted or removed compared to the first string. In this case, the function treats the change of "fox" to "goat" as a complete replacement of all characters after the change instead of just inserting the extra character in "goat".
> 
> To improve the algorithm's handling of insertions and deletions, I've modified the implementation below:

```
function stringDifference(str1, str2) {
  var i = 0, j = 0;
  var diffs = [];

  while (i < str1.length || j < str2.length) {
    if (str1[i] !== str2[j]) {
      if (str1[i + 1] === str2[j]) {
        diffs.push(['delete', i]);
        i++;
      } else if (str1[i] === str2[j + 1]) {
        diffs.push(['insert', i, str2[j]]);
        j++;
      } else {
        diffs.push(['replace', i, str2[j]]);
        i++;
        j++;
      }
    } else {
      i++;
      j++;
    }
  }

  return diffs;
}

function reconstructString(str1, diffs) {
  var str2 = "";
  var i = 0, j = 0;

  while (i < str1   [I halted the output here]
```


It was able to catch the hint, sort of: the revised code was capable of handling situations where the length of the document
changes, but only where exactly one character is added or removed at a time. It would not have helped for a difference of two
or more characters, e.g. changing “fox” to “chicken” or some other word with more than four letters.

I gave it a bit of help, by pointing this out explicitly, instead of just complaining about another bad test case:

> *I halted this response, because it seems like it would only help for insertion or deletion of one character at a time, which is not the only scenario we need to worry about.*

> You're correct that the provided solution has limitations when it comes to handling more complex insertions and deletions. A better approach would be to implement an algorithm like the Myers diff algorithm, which can handle a wider range of scenarios. However, the Myers algorithm can be more complex and may not be as efficient as the simpler algorithm provided earlier.
> 
> That being said, I'll provide a basic version of the Myers diff algorithm that should work for your use case:

```
function myersDiff(str1, str2) {
  var n = str1.length;
  var m = str2.length;
  var max = n + m;
  var v = new Array(2 * max + 1);
  v[1] = 0;

  var trace = [];

  for (var d = 0; d <= max; d++) {
    for (var k = -d; k <= d; k +=   [I halted the output here]
```

Now it’s trying a standard algorithm. The Myers algorithm is commonly used for the sort of document comparison task we have here,
but it’s much slower than GPT-4 was trying previously, which would already have been too slow. At this point, I gave it some
feedback about performance:

> *I tried the Myers diff algorithm, but it is executing much too slowly. It seems that the strings we need to compare are sometimes up to 50,000 characters in length.*

> I understand the performance concerns with the Myers diff algorithm for such large strings. In that case, let's try a different approach using a simple version of the Ratcliff/Obershelp pattern recognition algorithm. This algorithm should be faster for larger strings, although it might not be as accurate as the Myers diff algorithm.

```
function findLongestMatch(str1, str2) {
  var maxLen = 0;
  var index1 = -1;
  var index2 = -1;

  for (var i = 0; i < str1.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < str2.length; j++) {
      var k = 0;
      while (str1[i + k] === str2[j + k] && i + k < str1.length && j + k < str2.length) {
        k++;
      }
      if (k > maxLen) {
        maxLen = k;
        index1 = i;
        index2 = j;
      }
    }
  }

  return { length: maxLen, index1: index1, index2: index2 };
}

function ratcliffObershelpDiff(str1, str2) {
  var match = findLongestMatch(str1, str2);

  if (match.length === 0) {
    return [['replace', 0, str2]];
  }

  var diffs = [];

  if (match.index1 > 0 || match.index2 > 0) {
    diffs = diffs.concat(ratcliffObers   [I halted the output here]
```

The new algorithm it’s trying is even slower, and really not a good choice here. I gave it some feedback:

> *I finished this program and ran it, and it was very very slow.*

> I apologize for the performance issue. Since performance is a primary concern, we can try a custom approach that performs a basic sliding window comparison, and may work faster for larger strings. This approach might not be as accurate as other algorithms, but it should be much more efficient:

```
function slidingWindowDiff(str1, str2, windowSize) {
  var i = 0, j = 0;
  var diffs = [];

  while (i < str1.length || j < str2.length) {
    if (str1.slice(i, i + windowSize) === str2.slice(j, j + windowSize)) {
      i += windowSize;
      j += windowSize;
    } else if (i < str1.length && j < str2.length && str1[i] === str2[j]) {
      i++;
      j++;
    } else {
      var found = false;

      for (var k = 1; k <= windowSize; k++) {
        if (str1.slice(i, i + k) === str2.slice(j + k, j + k + k)) {
          diffs.push(['insert', i, str2.slice(j, j + k)]);
          j += k;
          found = true;
          break;
        } else if (str1.slice(i + k, i + k + k) === str2.slice(j, j + k)) {

          i += k;
          found = true;
          break;
        }
      }

      if (!found) {
        diffs.push(['replace', i, str2[j]]);
        i++;
        j++;
      }
    }
  }

  return diffs;
}

function reconstructString(str1, diffs) {
  var str2 = "";
  var i = 0, j = 0;

  while (i < str1.length || j < diffs.length) {
    if (j < diffs.length && i === diffs[j][1]) {
      if (diffs[j][0] === 'insert') {
        str2 += diffs[j][2];
      }
      i += (diffs[j][0] === 'delete') ? 1 : 0;
      j++;
    } else {
      str2 += str1[i] || "";
      i++;
    }
  }

  return str2;
}

var str1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
var str2 = "The quick brown goat jumps over the lazy dog";
var windowSize = 3; // You can adjust this parameter based on the expected differences in the strings
var diffs = slidingWindowDiff(str1, str2, windowSize);
var reconstructedStr = reconstructString(str1, diffs);

console.log("Differences:", diffs);
console.log("Reconstructed string:", reconstructedStr);
```

> This implementation uses a sliding window comparison to find differences between the two strings. You can adjust the `windowSize` parameter to balance accuracy and performance based on the expected differences in the input strings. A smaller window size will generally result in more accurate results, but may be slower.

Here, it has come up with a new approach that might be bit more efficient than looking at each individual character, but isn't
really very promising. It also contains at least one bug.

> *This generates incorrect output: "The quick brown foxt jumps over the lazy dog".*

> I apologize for the incorrect output. Here's an updated version of the sliding window algorithm that should fix the issue:

This code is also incorrect: it contains an infinite loop. At this point, I broke off the session.
