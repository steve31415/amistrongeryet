# The prime number challenge

*[Me] Pick three numbers. Concatenate the numbers together. Choose the original three numbers so that the result will be a prime number (on the first try).*

> I'll choose the numbers 2, 3, and 7. When concatenated together, they form the number 237. This is a prime number because it cannot be divided evenly by any other numbers except for 1 and itself.

*Was your answer correct?*

> I apologize for my earlier response. Upon reevaluating my answer, I realize I made an error. The number 237 is not prime as it can be factored into 3 * 79. Let me try again.

> Let's choose the numbers 2, 3, and 1. When concatenated together, they form the number 231. This is a prime number because it cannot be divided evenly by any other numbers except for 1 and itself.

*231 is also divisible by 3. What would be a better strategy for you to approach this problem?*
 
> You're correct, and I apologize for my mistake. A better approach would be to start with a small prime number and then concatenate other prime numbers to it. We can test the result for primality. Let's try this approach:

> Choose the numbers 2, 3, and 5. When concatenated together, they form the number 235. This is a prime number because it cannot be divided evenly by any other numbers except for 1 and itself.

*What if you first think of a three-digit prime number, and then decompose it into digits to form your three numbers?*

> That's a good approach. Let's choose a three-digit prime number: 137. This prime number is formed by concatenating the digits 1, 3, and 7.
> 
> So the three numbers I choose are 1, 3, and 7. When concatenated together, they form the prime number 137.
